                  <h3>Design Brief:</h3>
									<p>Provide people with access to greater social and economic opportunities by
closing the gap between technology-empowered and technology-excluded communities.</p>
									<h3>Process :</h3>
									<p>Lack of access to computers and Internet connectivity prevents the many benefits of information and communications technology (ICT) from reaching more than 4 billion people worldwide — benefits that include substantial social and economic development opportunities, often referred to as the “digital divide.” From 2000-2005, HP launched programs and projects under its e-inclusion initiative, which was designed to increase access to technology and accelerate economic development in underserved communities around the world. HP deployed technology to assist individuals and communities in areas including education and micro enterprise business development. Working as an intern from Bangalore, I conducted on the ground research and designed self sustaining business model development in villages in Andhra Pradesh, to explore how ICT can improve the lives of villagers and how HP can co-invent solutions to address their needs.</p>
									<h3>Metrics Of Success:</h3>
									<p>Two of our  projects were well received by the local community and HP got the opportunity to study behavioral patterns- An unfacilitated computer kiosk to expose the community to ICT and to understand usage models.
 An Internet-enabled large-size public display screen to provide access  to real time information and demonstrate the use of Internet to local inhabitants.</p>
